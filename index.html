            <br>
            <li>Why: <br>I took this course since they converged the EMC course into one IT course. EMC was my original plan. I will be taking game development electives when they are available though, but it is also nice to have a backup plan as I work my way to for a game developer position, under sound design. 

IT experience: I have been able to learn about programming since SHS, I would say they are not the best but I am working my way on improving them. Languages I have been able to program in are the ff:   
    <ul>
        <li>Java </li>
        <li>CSS  </li>
        <li>JavaScript   </li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>HTML </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
</li>
            <li>Hobbies/Interests/Libangan: My hobbies are playing video games, I enjoy listening and composing music, and I like sleeping.    </li>
            <br>
            <li>Goals in life: To find a job/position so I would be financially stable enough to not worry my parents. </li>
            <br>
            <li>What do you expect to learn from this course: I expect to learn about aspects of web programming that I have not learned from before and I expect to appreciate website programming more than I did before. </li>
            <br>
            <li>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major: I know that in my abilities my weakest aspect is in terms of designing and placement of elements in a given space. So I would like to strengthen my visual special/artistic skills. </li>
       </ol>
